### [About Me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-punsalang-1b0b99194/)
I'm recent graduate from the University of Irvine as a Computer and Information Science major and I've been interested in Web Development through my college career. I've been told that the Web is the most influential place and I want to be one of those people that can be part of it.
